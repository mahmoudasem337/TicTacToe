# TicTacToe

#### This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent utilizing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The game is written in Python and can be played in the terminal.

##### How to Play : 
1- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

3- Navigate to the directory where the game files are located.

4- Run the following command to start the game:
"python TicTacToe Game.py"

##### AI Algorithm (BFS) :
The AI opponent in this game is implemented using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. In the context of this game, BFS is used to explore all possible moves and select the optimal one.

##### Game Rules :
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has achieved a winning pattern, the game is a draw.
